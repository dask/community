Dask Community Discussion
=========================

This repository is used for discussion, announcements, and other community based activities.

This issue tracker is intended to be low-to-medium traffic.  Here are some proposed uses:

1.  Planning releases
2.  Announcing new Dask-related packages
3.  Announcing Monthly meetings
4.  Discussing conferences

Here are some counter-examples of topics that should not be raised here:

1.  General questions or bug reports.

    Please see [support documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/support.html) on where to ask questions.

2.  Governance changes.

    Please see the [dask/governance](https://github.com/dask/governance) repository

We hope that by removing these discussions from the high-traffic
[dask/dask](https://github.com/dask/dask/issues) issue tracker that more people
will feel comfortable subscribing to them.
